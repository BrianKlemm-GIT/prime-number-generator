# prime-number-generator
This is a C++ prime number generator. It generates prime numbers by user specified count. It then saves the found prime numbers to a .dat file. If a user later request a lesser number of prime numbers the program will provide them from the file instead of calculating them again. The program never calculates a prime twice.
